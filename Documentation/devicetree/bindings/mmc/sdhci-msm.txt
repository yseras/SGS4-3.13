* Qualcomm SDHCI controller (sdhci-msm)

This file documents differences between the core properties in mmc.txt
and the properties used by the sdhci-msm driver.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should contain "qcom,sdhci-msm".
- reg: Base address and length of the register set listed in reg-names.
- reg-names: Should contain the following:
	"hc_mem"   - Host controller register map
	"core_mem" - SD Core register map
- interrupts: Should contain an interrupt-specifiers for the interrupts listed in interrupt-names.
- interrupt-names: Should contain the following:
	"hc_irq"     - Host controller interrupt
	"pwr_irq"    - PMIC interrupt
- vdd-supply: Phandle to the regulator for the vdd (core voltage) supply.
- vdd-io-supply: Phandle to the regulator for the vdd-io (i/o voltage) supply.
- pinctrl-names: Should contain only one value - "default".
- pinctrl-0: Should specify pin control groups used for this controller.
- clocks: A list of phandle + clock-specifier pairs for the clocks listed in clock-names.
- clock-names: Should contain the following:
	"iface" - Main peripheral bus clock (PCLK/HCLK - AHB Bus clock) (required)
	"core"	- SDC MMC clock (MCLK) (required)
	"bus"	- SDCC bus voter clock (optional)

Optional properties:

- qcom,vdd-voltage-min - Specifies the minimum core voltage supported by the device in microvolts.
- qcom,vdd-voltage-max - Specifies the maximum core voltage supported by the device in microvolts.
- qcom,vdd-io-voltage-min - Specifies the minimum i/o voltage supported by the device in microvolts.
- qcom,vdd-io-voltage-max - Specifies the maximum i/o voltage supported by the device in microvolts.
